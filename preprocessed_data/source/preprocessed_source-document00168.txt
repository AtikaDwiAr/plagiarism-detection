urtheil gesprochen welch die unbewusst vorstellung de zweck jedem einzelnen fall vorwiegt denn wollt man nun noch die vorstellung de geistesmechanismu festhalten musst fur jede variat und modif de instinct nach den ausseren umstanden ein besonder constant vorrichtung eingefugt seinphilosophi unconsci ed p indessen glaub ich dass die angefuhrten beispiel zur genug beweisen dass es auch viel fall giebt wo ohn jede complic mit der bewussten ueberlegung die gewohnlich und aussergewohnlich handlung au derselben quell stammen dass sie entwed beid wirklich instinct oder beid result bewusst ueberlegung sindphilosophi unconsci ed p dagegen haben wir nunmehr unseren blick noch einmal scharfer auf den begriff ein psychischen mechanismu zu richten und da zeigt sich dass derselb abgesehen davon wie viel er erklart dunk list dass man sich kaum etwa dabei denken kannphilosophi unconsci ed p da endgli tritt al bewusst will zu irgend einer handlung auf beid sind aber ganz ungleichartig und haben mit der gewohnlichen motiv nicht zu thun welch ausschliesslich darin besteht dass die vorstellung einer lust oder einer unlust da begehren erzeugr erster zu erlangen letzter sich fern zu haltenibid p dies causal verbindung fallt erfahrungsmassig wie wir von unsern menschlichen instincten wissen nicht in bewussisein folglich kann dieselb wenn sie ein mechanismu sein soll nur entwed ein nicht in bewusstsein fallend mechanisch leitung und umwandlung der schwingungen de vorgestellten motiv die schwingungen der gewollten handlung im gehirn oder ein unbewusst geistig mechanismu seinphilosophi unconsci ed p b man hat sich also zwischen dem bewussten motiv und dem willen zur insticthandlung ein causal verbindung durch unbewusst vorstellen und wollen zu denken und ich weiss nicht wie dies verbindung einfach gedacht werden konnt al durch den vorgestellten und gewollten zweck damit sind wir aber bei dem allen geistern eigenthumlichen und immanenten mechanismu der logik angelangt und haben die unbewusst zweckvorstellung bei jeder einzelnen instincthandlung al unentbehrlich gli gefunden hiermit hat also der begrift de todten ausserlich pradestinirten geistesmechanismu sich selbst aufgehoben und da immanent geistesleben der logik umgewandelt und wir sind bei der letzten moglichkeit angekommen welch fur die auffassung ein wirklichen instinct ubrig bleibt der instinct ist bewusst wollen de mittel zu einem unbewusst gewollten zweckphilosophi unconsci ed p also der instinct ohn hulfsmechanismu die ursach der entstehung de hulfsmechanismu istphilosophi unconsci ed p b dass auch der fertig hulfsmechanismu da unbewusst nicht etwa zu dieser bestimmten instincthandlung necessirt sondern bloss pradisponirtphilosophi unconsci ed p c giebt es einen wirklichen instinct oder sind die sogenannten instincthandlungen nur result bewusst ueberlegung philosophi unconsci ed p dieser bewei ist dadurch zu fuhren ersten dass die betreffenden thatsachen der zukunft liegen und dem verstand die anhaltepunkt fehlen um ihr zukunftig eintreten au den gegenwartigen verhaltnissen zu erschliessen zweiten dass die betreffenden thatsachen augenscheinlich der sinnlichen wahrnehmung verschlossen liegen weil nur die erfahrung fruher fall uber sie belehren kann und dies laut der beobachtung ausgeschlossen ist es wurd fur unser interessen keinen unterschi machen wenn ich wahrscheinlich halt bei fortschreitend physiologisch erkenntniss all jetzt fur den ersten fall anzufuhrenden beispiel sich al solch de zweiten fall ausweisen sollten wie die unleugbar bei vielen fruher gebrauchten beispielen schon geschehen ist denn ein apriorisch wissen ohn jeden sinnlichen anstoss ist wohl kaum wunderbar zu nennen al ein wissen welch zwar bei gelegenheit gewiss sinnlich wahrnehmung zu tage tritt aber mit diesen nur durch ein solch kett von schlussen und angewandten kenntnissen verbindung stehend gedacht werden konnt dass deren moglichkeit bei dem zustand der fahigkeiten und bildung der betreffenden thier entschieden geleugnet werden mussphilosophi unconsci ed p man hat dieselb jederzeit anerkannt und mit den worten vorgefuhl oder ahnung bezeichnet indess beziehen sich dies wort einerseit nur auf zukunftig nicht auf gegenwartig raumlich getrennt unwahmehrnbar anderseit bezeichnen sie nur die leis dumpf unbestimmt resonanz de bewusstsein mit dem unfehlbar bestimmten zustand der unbewussten erkenntniss daher da wort vorgefuhl rucksicht auf die dumpfheit und unbestimmtheit wahrend doch leicht zu sehen ist dass da von allen auch den unbewussten vorstellungen entblosst gefuhl fur da resultat gar keinen einfluss haben kann sondern nur ein vorstellung weil dies allein erkenntniss enthalt die bewusstsein mitklingend ahnung kann allerd unter umstanden ziemlich deutlich sein dass sie sich beim menschen gedanken und wort fixiren lasst doch ist die auch im menschen erfahrungsmassig bei den eigenthumlichen instincten nicht der fall vielmehr ist bei diesen die resonanz der unbewussten erkenntniss im bewusstsein meisten schwach dass sie sich wirklich nur begleitenden gefuhlen oder der stimmung aussert dass sie einen unendlich kleinen bruchtheil de gemeingefuhl bildet philosophi unconsci ed p der bestimmung de willen durch einen im unbewussten liegenden process fur welchen sich dieser charact der zweifellosen selbstgewissheit allen folgenden untersuchungen bewahren wirdphilosophi unconsci p b sondern al unmittelbar besitz vorgefunden wird philosophi unconsci p c hellsehen da hellsehon de unbewussten hat sie den rechten weg ahnen lassenphilosophi unconsci p ed b man wird doch wahrlich nicht den thieren zumuthen wollen durch meteorologisch schluss da wetter auf monat im vorau zu berechnen ja sogar ueberschwemmungen vorauszusehen vielmehr ist ein solch gefuhlswahrnehmung gegenwartig atmospharisch einfluss nicht weiter al die sinnlich wahrnehmung welch al motiv wirkt und ein motiv muss ja doch immer vorhanden sein wenn ein instinct functioniren soll es bleibt also trotzdem bestehen dass da voraussehen der witterung ein unbewusst hellsehen ist von dem der storch der vier wochen fruher nach suden aufbricht wenig etwa weiss al der hirsch der sich vor einem kalten winter einen dickeren pelz al gewohnlich wachsen lasst die thier haben eben einerseit da gegenwartig witterungsgefuhl im bewusstsein darau folgt andererseit ihr handeln gerad al ob sie die vorstellung der zukunftigen witterung hatten im bewusstsein haben sie dieselb aber nicht also bietet sich al einzig naturlich mittelgli die unbewusst vorstellung die nun aber immer ein hellsehen ist weil sie etwa enthalt dem thier weder dutch sinnlich wahrnehmung direct gegeben ist noch durch sein verstandesmittel au der wahrnehmung geschlossen werden kannphilosophi unconsci p ed meistentheil tritt aber hier der hoheren bewusstseinstuf der menschen entsprechend ein starket resonanz de bewusstsein mit dem bewussten hellsehen hervor die sich also mehr odor minder deutlich ahnung darstellt ausserdem entspricht es der grosseren selbststandigkeit de menschlichen intellect dass dies ahnung nicht ausschliesslich behuf der unmittelbaren ausfuhrung einer handlung eintritt sondern bisweilen auch unabangig von der bedingung einer momentan zu leistenden al bloss vorstellung ohn bewussten willen sich zeigt wenn nur die bedingung erfullt ist dass der gegenstand dies ahnen den willen de ahnenden im allgemeinen hohem grade interessirtphilosophi unconsci ed p haufig sind die ahnungen denen da hellsehen de unbewussten sich dem bewusstsein offenbart dunkel unverstandlich und symbolisch weil sie im gehirn sinnlich form annehmen mussen wahrend die unbewusst vorstellung der form der sinnlichkeit kein theil haben kannphilosophi unconsci ed p ebenso weil es dies reih nur gesteigert bewusstseinresonanz fortsetzt stutzt es jene aussagen der instincthandlungen uher ihr eigen wesen ebenso sehr c philosophi unconsci ed p wir werden trotzdem dies gomeinsam wirkung ein masseninstinct der entstehung der sprach und den grossen politischen und socialen bewegungen der woltgeschicht deutlich wieder erkennen hier handelt es sich um moglichst einfach und deutlich beispiel und darum greifen wir zu niederen thieren wo die mittel der gedankenmittheilung bei fehlend stimm mimik und physiognomi unvollkommen sind dass die uebereinstimmung und da ineinandergreifen der einzelnen leistungen den hauptsachen unmoglich der bewussten verstandigung durch sprach zugeschrieben werden darfphilosophi unconsci ed p und wie durch instinct dot plan de ganzen stock unbewusstem hellsehen jeder einzelnen bien einwohntphilosophi unconsci ed p b indem jede individuum den plan de ganzen und sammtlich gegenwartig zu ergreifend mittel im unbewussten hellsehen hat wovon aber nut da ein ihm zu thun obliegt sein bewusstsein falltphilosophi unconsci ed p der instinct ist nicht resultat bewusst ueberlegung nicht folg der korperlichen organis nicht bloss resultat ein der organis de gehirn gelegenen mechanismu nicht wirkung ein dem geist von aussen angeklebten todten seinem innersten wesen fremden mechanismu sondern selbsteigen leistung de individuum au seinem innersten wesen und charact entspringend philosophi unconsci ed p haufig ist die kenntniss de zweck der bewussten erkenntniss durch sinnlich wahrnehmung gar nicht zuganglich dann
